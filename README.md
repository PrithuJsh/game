Simple Drag and Drop
Highest Number educational game

OLE-Nepal is a non-governmental organization dedicated to assisting the Government of Nepal in meeting its Education for all goals by developing freely accessible, open-source Information and Communication. Most of their activities before, used flash, but now they are slowly transitioning into html 5 because flash uses more memory and most of the device that OLE-Nepal uses are limited to its computer power. 

Since the device has limited power, they have been looking for alternate resources to make their activities run smoothly. So, they are using html5 because of its many advantages for having different ways to execute file types, which are more efficient and use less resources. 

For animation they use sprite image, which are a collection of images put into a single image. A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests. Some of the advantages of using a sprite images are, it reduces the number of server request and save bandwidth. 

Also, for image file they use png file due to its many advantages. Some of its advantages are: It is best suited for serving in,internet as per itâ€™s name,Portable Network Graphics, Smaller in size, Supports transparency.

 And as for sound files, OGG are best because  it is common on most of the browser and it is the smallest size among the other sound file format.
